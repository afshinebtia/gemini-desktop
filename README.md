# Google Gemini Desktop Client (Electron)
I've developed a straightforward desktop client for Google Gemini (formerly Bard) using the Electron framework.
A precompiled version for Windows is now accessible here:

[Gemini-Desktop (Windows Set-Up)](https://github.com/nekupaw/gemini-desktop/releases/download/1.0.1/Gemini-Desktop.Setup.1.0.1.exe)

For other systems, simply adapt and build the source code to suit your needs.

This client operates by utilizing a WebView container to access the Gemini website and implements various modifications for enhanced user experience.
With the shortcut Windows Key + G, Gemini can be opened from anywhere.
tip: use the installer and copy the shortcut from the desktop to the startup folder, .
